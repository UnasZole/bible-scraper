# This "Generic HTML" scraper for TheoPlace is provided as an example, both of the power of generic scrapers and their
# limitations.
# In particular, the limitations of this generic scraper are the following :
# - Notes are always pushed to the end of a verse, because a generic parser iterates through HTML elements, not nodes
#   inside these elements. Therefore it cannot track how elements are positioned in the middle of text.
# - Chapters and books that are missing in some bibles will actually be included as empty, because generic parsers do
#   not provide a mechanism to ignore pages after parsing them.
# For these reasons, when extracting bibles for actual use, the native TheoPlace scraper should be used instead !
