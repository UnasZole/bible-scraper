# This "Generic HTML" scraper for TheoPlace is provided as an example, both of the power of generic scrapers and their
# limitations.
# In particular, the limitations of this generic scraper are the following :
# - In some bibles, major and normal sections will be messed up because the website's formatting on those is inconsistent.
#   The generic parser cannot include complex logic based on sibling comparisons to cope with such inconsistencies.
# - Chapters and books that are missing in some bibles will actually be included as empty, because generic parsers do
#   not provide a mechanism to ignore pages after parsing them.
# For these reasons, when extracting bibles for actual use, the native TheoPlace scraper should be used instead !

description: "Bibles multiples de theo.place"
patterns:
  # By using the default name "bookUrl" and leaving the pagePattern unset, this pattern will be implicitly used at book level.
  bookUrl: "https://theo.place/intro-livre-{BIBLE}-{BOOK_NB}-{BOOK_NAME}"
  # By using the default name "chapterUrl" and leaving the pagePattern unset, this pattern will be implicitly used at chapter level.
  chapterUrl: "https://theo.place/bible-{BIBLE}-{BOOK_NB}-{CHAPTER}"
  # By using the default name "chapterPublishedNumber" and leaving the pagePattern unset, this pattern will be implicitly used at chapter level.

args:
  # By default, the CHAPTER argument should be evaluated only within chapter sequence, and default to $i, the OSIS chapter number.
